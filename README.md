3. Classifier_105_3_class.py: three classes, only linguistic features
4. Classifier_105_3_class_count.py: three classes, linguistic and word features

2. data_science_ass_2_count: Three class, linguistic and word vars
3. data_science_ass_2_2_class: Two class, only linguistic vars
4. data_science_ass_2_count_2_class: Two class, linguistic and word vars
